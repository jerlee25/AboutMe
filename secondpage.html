    <h1>Let's Talk About <em>CIPHERS</em></h1>
    <p>Once upon a time, people decided they didn't like other people reading their stuff.</p>
    <p>So, they started making things called <strong>ciphers!</strong></p>
    <p>There are a lot of ciphers, some of my favorites being:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The Pigpen Cipher!</li>
        <li>The Playfair Cipher!</li>
        <li>Bacon's Cipher!</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>What's So Cool About Ciphers?</h2>
    <p>Ciphers are great because they can be used for so many things like,</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Making messages for your friends!</li>
        <li>Hiding secret notes only you can read!</li>
        <li>Planning to assassinate a member of your family!</li>
    </ol>
    <p>But don't just take my word for it, take the word of Mary Queen of Scots, an avid enjoyer of ciphers, particularly for purpose #3!</p>

    <p><em>"I just love using ciphers to chat with my dearest pals across the country! <br>
        I can speak with them about whatever my heart desires, even my intent to murder my cousin! <br>
        If people found out what I was saying, they would chop off my head, and that wouldn't do at all!<br>
        Fortunately, I can rest easy knowing that my ciphers will make sure no one ever unearths my machinations!"</em> - Mary Queen of Scots, 2022</p>
    <p>Wow! What a genuine review from a lovely person!</p>
